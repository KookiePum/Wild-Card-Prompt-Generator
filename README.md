This is my first time uploading on github so mistakenly uploaded files as .zip🥀

This is a local prompt/wild cards generator .exe that can be customized to own accords.

How to use:

Extract .zip file.
dist > wildcard_gen.exe.
Click GENERATE PROMPT.

Notes for customization:

If a .txt was already present inside Loaded Wildcards and then was added again then it will add numbers to the file name.
Click Save Wildcards so that there won't be no need to add them again when opening up the UI. Saved Wildcards will be presented within dist > wild card text.
Format of making your own wild card is easy, take a look at already presented wild cards within wild card text.
If want to remove a wild card, then remove it from the wild card text folder.
Tags can be added or removed from already presented wild cards. And wild cards can be renamed.
Currently UI only support .txt as file support.
Currently there are only dresses and hair styles related wild cards, so a user doesn't get overwhelmed. Feel free to add your own SFW/NSFW wild card.
